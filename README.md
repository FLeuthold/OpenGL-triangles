# OpenGL-triangles
Some triangle programms for better understanding of OpenGL basics

I created a OpenGL project with the repository of the OpenGL SuperBible. I simply edited the CmakeLists.txt file in the repository and followed the steps in the HOWTOBUILD.txt file of the repository. You also need to know first about the fact, that you NEED to properly set up the .sln file with cmake and not just randomly create a new .sln file in Visual Studio. I'll share diffrent variations of triangles with you, programs that aren't included in the sb7-book. It would be great if I can help you with that.
